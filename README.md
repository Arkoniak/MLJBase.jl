## MLJInterface

The model interface for
[MLJ](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl), a Julia
machine learning framework.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJInterface.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJInterface.jl)

MLJ is a Julia framework for building and tuning machine learning
models. Any machine learning algorithms written in Julia can be used
by MLJ if it is defined in a package importing MLJInterface and
implementing the model API it defines. For more information see
[Implementing the MLJ interface for a learning
algorithm](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl/blob/master/doc/adding_new_models.md).
